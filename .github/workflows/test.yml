# GitHub Actions Workflow for Automated Testing
# This workflow runs pytest tests to ensure code quality and functionality
#
# Triggers:
# - Push events to the main branch
# - Pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened)
# - Manual workflow dispatch through GitHub UI

name: Run Tests

on:
  # Trigger on push to main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Trigger on pull requests
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allow manual triggering from GitHub Actions UI

  test:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment
      # Using Python 3.9 as the default version (repo minimum is 3.8)
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
          cache: 'pip'

      # Step 3: Install Python dependencies
      # Install all packages listed in requirements.txt
      # Caching is enabled to speed up subsequent workflow runs
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt

      # Step 4: Run pytest tests
      # Execute all tests with verbose output (configured in pytest.ini)
      # Using short traceback format for cleaner output
      - name: Run tests with pytest
        run: |
          pytest --tb=short

      # Step 5: Generate test summary
      # Display a summary of test results in the workflow logs
      - name: Test Summary
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "==================================="
          echo "Test execution completed"
          echo "==================================="
          echo "Check the logs above for detailed test results"
