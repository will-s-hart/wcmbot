# GitHub Actions Workflow for Automated Testing
# This workflow runs pytest tests to ensure code quality and functionality
#
# Triggers:
# - Push events to the main branch
# - Pull request events (opened, synchronized, reopened)
# - Manual workflow dispatch through GitHub UI

name: Run Tests

on:
  # Trigger on push to main branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main

  # Trigger on pull requests
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - main

  # Allow manual triggering from GitHub Actions UI
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  test:
    # Use the latest Ubuntu runner provided by GitHub
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Explicitly set minimal permissions for security
    # Only read access to repository contents is needed for running tests
    permissions:
      contents: read

    steps:
      # Step 1: Check out the repository code
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Python environment
      # Using Python 3.12 as the minimum version
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.12'

      # Step 3: Install uv
      # Use the Astral uv action for efficient dependency management
      - name: Install uv
        uses: astral-sh/setup-uv@v7

      # Step 4: Install Python dependencies
      # Use uv to sync all dependencies from pyproject.toml
      # Caching is handled automatically by uv
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          uv sync --all-extras

      # Step 5: Install Playwright browsers
      # Required for E2E tests
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: |
          uv run playwright install chromium

      # Step 6: Run pytest tests
      # Execute all tests with verbose output (configured in pytest.ini)
      # Using short traceback format for cleaner output
      - name: Run tests with pytest
        run: |
          uv run pytest --tb=short

      # Step 7: Generate test summary
      # Display a summary of test results in the workflow logs
      - name: Test Summary
        if: always()
        run: |
          echo "==================================="
          echo "Test execution completed"
          echo "==================================="
          echo "Check the logs above for detailed test results"
