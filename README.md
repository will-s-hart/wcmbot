# 🧩 Jigsaw Puzzle Solver

A Django web application that helps solve jigsaw puzzles by identifying where individual pieces fit in a template image using computer vision techniques.

## Features

- **Upload puzzle piece images** and automatically find their position in the template
- **Visual highlighting** of the matched position on the template
- **Confidence scoring** for match quality
- **Upload history** tracking all previously matched pieces
- **Responsive web interface** with modern UI/UX
- **HuggingFace Spaces ready** with Gradio interface
- **Fully tested** with pytest and Playwright

## How It Works

The application uses OpenCV-based computer vision algorithms to match puzzle pieces:

1. **Template Matching**: Uses normalized cross-correlation to find similar regions
2. **Feature Detection**: Uses ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) for more robust matching
3. **Position Highlighting**: Marks the matched location with visual indicators

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/will-s-hart/wcmbot.git
cd wcmbot
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

4. Create sample puzzle data (optional):
```bash
python create_sample_images.py
```

5. Run the development server:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

6. Access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Usage

### Django Web Interface

1. Navigate to the home page to see available puzzles
2. Click on a puzzle to open the detail page
3. Upload a puzzle piece image using the upload interface
4. The app will automatically find and highlight the piece location
5. View confidence score and exact coordinates of the match

### Gradio Interface (HuggingFace Spaces)

Run the Gradio app:
```bash
python app.py
```

Or deploy directly to HuggingFace Spaces by pushing this repository.

### Admin Interface

Access the Django admin at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/` to:
- Add new puzzle templates
- View all uploaded pieces and their matches
- Manage puzzle data

Create a superuser first:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive test coverage:

### Unit Tests

Run pytest tests for models, views, and matching logic:
```bash
pytest puzzle/tests.py -v
```

### End-to-End Tests

Run Playwright tests for full UI workflow:
```bash
pytest tests_e2e.py -v
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest -v
```
